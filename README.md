# yubiKey exercise
An `U2F` authentication by hardware keys exercise

Hardware keys :closed_lock_with_key: also called `FIDO security keys` are yet another solution to verify the user who is trying to log-in.  
An example of a key :key: is this one manufactured by Yubico  
![YubiKey 5 NFC](/static/images/yubiKey.jpg "YubiKey 5 NFC - a hardware u2f verification key")  

Training `U2F` authentication by hardware keys is the main purpose of this repo  
and because of this, `SOLID`, "magic numbers" etc. are not the most important concern.  
Obsolete in normal circumstances (in production) logs like `console.log`'s, `print`'s etc. will be used also.  

It will include more independent sub-projects or tasks related to yubiKey `U2F` development.
